# Introducing a cutting-edge(RAG) system, powered by LangChain framework with Google Gemini pro

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest Project:

Introducing a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, powered by the innovative LangChain framework with Google Gemini 1.5 Pro !

RAG system pull right information from the research paper and adds it to the answers it gives. So when you ask something you get really detailed answers. Because it combines and connects both the PDF Data and open source information on internetðŸ¤– ðŸ›œ

Here's the scoop: RAG takes the fusion of information to a whole new level by blending data from PDFs and text files with our Language Model Models (LLMs). Essentially, it's like boosting our LLMs with real-world data, equipping them with superpowers! ðŸ’¥

With LangChain at the helm, I've crafted an exceptional RAG system that harnesses the prowess of Gemini 1.5 Pro. To unravel the depths of the research paper "Leave No Context Behind," brought to you by the brilliant minds at Google.

Why is this a game-changer? Because RAG doesn't just provide answers; it crafts responses infused with deep insights gleaned directly from the paper.

Ask a question, and you'll receive a comprehensive, logical answer that leaves no stone unturned.
